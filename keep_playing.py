#  Keep Playing?
#
#  This routine takes the status of the last round played and determines if the round should
#  automatically continue, or stop and ask the player.
#
#  Rules:
#    1.  If the playmode is 0, (rolling for point):
#         (a)  If the player has *NOT* lost, automatically continue.
#         (b)  If the player *HAS* lost the come-out roll, ask.
